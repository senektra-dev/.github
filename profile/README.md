# Welcome


This organization is a way for me to group all repositories I use for learning. Everything you'll find here is either
learning examples and/or projects. Please don't expect anything to work. And for that matter, if anything does, don't
expect maintenance upkeep.

However there are some exceptions; I will keep updated any milestone projects that I feel are good portfolio pieces.
Only for the sake of marketability.

## The Point of All This

I like to follow along to courses online as I feel that's the best way I learn. Otherwise I end up with 20 different
tabs in a browser with all being completely unrelated subject material.

So to keep myself on the right track and disuade distractions with the courses I find online, I've created this README
to supplement my repositories and learning. Like a guide of sorts, with prograss completion tracking.

## The Courses

> ðŸ—“ I'll update the tables every sunday.

I try to keep a primary focus on at most three courses. You'll see my progress with them in the following table. The 
table is mostly for me as a reminder to not start seven something courses and ultimately finish none of them.

|               Course                            | Conpleted |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| udemy-exp: Just Express. In Detail.             |    45%    |
| udemy-vue: Vue Masterclass                      |     0%    |
|   ztm-crd: Complete React Developer             |     0%    |

### Upcoming

- > udemy-tail: Tailwind CSS From Scratch
  - `Follows udemy-exp`
  - I was gonna take some time to learn bootstrap, but I've decided I'd rather try my hand at tailwind. I understand
    they are not fundamentally the same, but I believe both can achieve a desirable goal of putting out a website
    faster. I just prefer tailwind's take with the utility-first paradigm.
- > ztm-sql: Complete SQL + Databases
  - `Follows any, except udemy-exp`
  - Want to learn how to use a sql database and manage it properly.

## Supportive

As stated, those are my **primary** focuses. They're ones I try to really drill into on a day to day basis. The 
following table represents what I call my support courses. They represent things I'll learn whether I do it via course 
content or through pet projects. As such, I tend to go through these at around half pace. I keep these at a solid two.

|               Course                             | Conpleted |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| udemy-mhc: Modern HTML & CSS From the Beginning  |    49%    |
| udemy-mjb: The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course |    40%    |
