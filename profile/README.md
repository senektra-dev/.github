# Welcome


This organization is a way for me to group all repositories I use for learning. Everything you'll find here is either
learning examples and/or projects. Please don't expect anything to work. And for that matter, if anything does, don't
expect maintenance upkeep.

However there are some exceptions; I will keep updated any milestone projects that I feel are good portfolio pieces.
Only for the sake of marketability.

## The Point of All This

I like to follow along to courses online as I feel that's the best way I learn. Otherwise I end up with 20 different
tabs in a browser with all being completely unrelated subject material.

So to keep myself on the right track and disuade distractions with the courses I find online, I've created this README
to supplement my repositories and learning. Like a guide of sorts, with progress completion tracking.

## The Courses

> ðŸ—“ I'll update the tables every sunday.

I try to keep a primary focus on at most three courses. You'll see my progress with them in the following table. The 
table is mostly for me as a reminder to not start seven something courses and ultimately finish none of them.

|                     Courses                      |      Completed    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
|    ztm-crd: Complete React Developer             |     34% (â†‘10%)    |
|  udemy-exp: Just Express. In Detail.             |     80% (â†‘12%)    |
| udemy-tail: Tailwind CSS From Scratch            |     10% (â†‘0%)     |

### Upcoming

- > ztm-sql: Complete SQL â†’ ztm-aws: AWS
  - `Follows any except ztm-crd`
  - MongoDB, SQL, MongoDB. Back to SQL, most courses I'm currently learning from use some relational database. I can
    save MongoDB for later.
- > ztm-tsc: Typescript â†’ udemy-cyp: Cypress
  - `Follows any except ztm-crd`
  - Gotta move on to Typescript at some point.
- > udemy-misv: 
  - `Follows ztm-crd`
  - This is a big one, but it covers just about everything I want to learn after finishing most of everything else.

There's going to be a special case here with udemy-mjb from my support classes. If I somehow manage to finish
ztm-crd before it, I will instead move udemy-mjb into its place, thus delaying udemy-misv. I really want my Javascript
to feel strong when I get to it, and therefore don't want to leave any loose ends.

## Support Courses

As stated, the above courses are my **primary** focuses. They're ones I try to really drill into on a day to day basis. 
The following table represents what I call my support courses. They represent things I'll learn whether I do it via 
course content or through pet projects. As such, I tend to go through these at around half pace. I keep these at a 
solid two.

|               Course                             |     Completed    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| udemy-mhc: Modern HTML & CSS From the Beginning  |    66% (â†‘5%)    |
| udemy-mjb: The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course |    40% (â†‘0%)     |

### Upcoming

- > udemy-acs: Advanced CSS and Sass
  - `Follows udemy-mhc`
  - Continue learning html and css. Familiarize myself with sass.
- > udemy-jut: Javascript Unit Testing
  - `Follows udemy-mjb`
  - Learn to test. If there is one thing I never really gave time to, it was testing. Looking back, I really regret that.

# Last But Not Least

The following table lists all courses I've completed to date.
