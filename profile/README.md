# Welcome


This organization is a way for me to group all repositories I use for learning. Everything you'll find here is either
learning examples and/or projects. Please don't expect anything to work. And for that matter, if anything does, don't
expect maintenance upkeep.

However there are some exceptions; I will keep updated any milestone projects that I feel are good portfolio pieces.
Only for the sake of marketability.

## The Point of All This

I like to follow along to courses online as I feel that's the best way I learn. Otherwise I end up with 20 different
tabs in a browser with all being completely unrelated subject material.

So to keep myself on the right track and disuade distractions with the courses I find online, I've created this README
to supplement my repositories and learning. Like a guide of sorts, with prograss completion tracking.

## The Courses

> ðŸ—“ I'll update the tables every sunday.

I try to keep a primary focus on at most three courses. You'll see my progress with them in the following table. The 
table is mostly for me as a reminder to not start seven something courses and ultimately finish none of them.

|                     Courses                      | Completed |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
|    ztm-crd: Complete React Developer             |     7%    |
|  udemy-exp: Just Express. In Detail.             |    62%    |
| udemy-tail: Tailwind CSS From Scratch            |     0%    |

### Upcoming

- > udemy-mon: MongoDb
  - `Follows any except ztm-crd`
  - I originally wanted to learn SQL first, but from what I see myself building early on, learning mongoDB now would
    probably pay off better.
- > ztm-tsc: Typescript
  - `Follows any except ztm-crd`
  - Gotta move on to Typescript at some point.
- > udemy-misv: 
  - `Follows ztm-crd`
  - This is a big one, but it covers just about everything I want to learn after finishing most of everything else.

There's going to be a special case here with udemy-mjb from my support classes. If I somehow manage to finish
ztm-crd before it, I will instead move udemy-mjb into its place, thus delaying udemy-misv. I really want my Javascript
to feel strong when I get to it, and therefore don't want to leave any loose ends.

## Support Courses

As stated, the above courses are my **primary** focuses. They're ones I try to really drill into on a day to day basis. 
The following table represents what I call my support courses. They represent things I'll learn whether I do it via 
course content or through pet projects. As such, I tend to go through these at around half pace. I keep these at a 
solid two.

|               Course                             | Completed |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| udemy-mhc: Modern HTML & CSS From the Beginning  |    49%    |
| udemy-mjb: The Modern Javascript Bootcamp Course |    40%    |
