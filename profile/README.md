# Welcome


This organization is a way for me to group all repositories I use for learning. Everything you'll find here is either
learning examples and/or projects. Please don't expect anything to work. And for that matter, if anything does, don't
expect upkeep.

However there are some exceptions; I will keep updated any milestone projects that I feel are good portfolio pieces.
Only for the sake of marketability.

## The Point of All This

I like to follow along to courses online as I feel that's the best way I learn. Otherwise I end up with 20 different
tabs in a browser with all being completely unrelated subject material.

So to keep myself on the right track and disuade distractions with the courses I find online, I've created this README
to supplement my repositories and learning. Like a guide of sorts, with progress completion tracking.

## The Courses

> ðŸ—“ I'll update the tables every sunday.

I try to keep a primary focus on at most two courses. You'll see my progress with them in the following table. The 
table is mostly for me as a reminder to not start seven something courses and ultimately finish none of them.

|                     Courses                      |      Completed    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
|       ztm-cwd: Complete Web Developer            |     39% (0%)      |
|  coursera-tsf: Technical Support Fundamentals    |     22% (0%)      |

[as of 02/01/23]

### Upcoming

- > ztm-crd: Complete React Developer
  - `Follows ztm-cwd`
  - Learn React
- > Coursera IBM DevOps and Software Engineering -> ossu-cs: OSSU Computer Science
  - `Follows Coursera: Google IT Support`
  - Finish what I set out to do.

There's going to be a special case here with udemy-mjb from my support classes. If I somehow manage to finish
ztm-crd before it, I will instead move udemy-mjb into its place, thus delaying udemy-misv. I really want my Javascript
to feel strong when I get to it, and therefore don't want to leave any loose ends.

## Support Courses

As stated, the above courses are my **primary** focuses. They're ones I try to really drill into on a day to day basis. 
The following table represents what I call my support courses. They represent things I'll learn whether I do it via 
course content or through pet projects. As such, I tend to go through these at around half pace. I'm doing my best to
learn one course at a time.

|               Course                             |     Completed    |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |

### Upcoming

- > udemy-mhc: Modern HTML and CSS -> udemy-acs: Advanced CSS and Sass
  - Continue learning html and css.
